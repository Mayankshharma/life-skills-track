## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?


* If I face such behavior:
    * I would try to put a stop to that behavior by a verbal confirmation saying that this is not acceptable to me.

    * Connect with others who you think might have been mistreated or harassed at work. Support one another and come forward together.

* If I witness such behavior:
    * I will try to access the situation and figure out a way to help out the victim if that doesn't make the situation worse.
    * If it is safe to intervene, I will directly confront the person who is harassing the victim and be a witness to what happened.
    * If direct intervention is not safe, I would contact my higher officials and HR regarding this and enlighten them about the situation.
    * Will have a record of the harassment including the witnesses and proofs.
