# Listening and Active Communication
Q1.) What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?

Ans )
There are five key elements of active listening. They all help you ensure that you hear the other person and that the other person knows you are listening to what they say.

* Pay attention. Give the speaker your undivided attention, and acknowledge the message. Recognize that non-verbal communication also "speaks" loudly. Look at the speaker directly. Put aside distracting thoughts. "Listen" to the speaker's body language. Refrain from side conversations when listening in a group setting.
* Show that you are listening. Use your body language and gestures to convey your attention. Nod occasionally. Smile and use other facial expressions. Note your posture and make sure it is open and inviting. Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like “Yes”.
* Read the body language of the speaker.
* Provide feedback. Provide good feedback to the speaker and ask questions if you have any
* Defer judgment. Don't make a judgment until the speaker is done with their point.
* Respond Appropriately. Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. You are gaining information and perspective. You add nothing by attacking the speaker or otherwise putting him or her down. Be candid, open, and honest in your response. Assert your opinions respectfully.
